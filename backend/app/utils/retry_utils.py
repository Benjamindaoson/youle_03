"""Jittered exponential backoff for decorrelated retries.

Adapted from hermes-agent (MIT) © Nous Research — ``agent/retry_utils.py``.

Use instead of fixed exponential backoff anywhere multiple workers/sessions
might hit the same upstream concurrently (LLM calls, OSS, MCP servers).
Without jitter, a transient 429 cascades into a thundering-herd retry spike.
